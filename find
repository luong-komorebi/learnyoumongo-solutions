 FIND
 Exercise 3 of 9

Here we will learn how to search for documents.

In this exercise the database name is learnyoumongo.
So, the url would be something like: mongodb://localhost:27017/learnyoumongo

Use the parrots collection to find all documents where age
is greater than the first argument passed to your script.

Using console.log, print the documents to stdout.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

To connect to the database, one can use something like this:

    var mongo = require('mongodb').MongoClient
    mongo.connect(url, function(err, db) {
      // db gives access to the database
    })

To get a collection, one can use db.collection('<collection name>').

To find a document or documents, one needs to call find() on the collection.

Find is a little bit different than what we are used to seeing.

To access the arguments you can use the process.argv array of strings (the first argument is stored at the third position process.argv[2]). To convert to an integer, you could use parseInt()

Here is an example:

    collection.find({
      name: 'foo'
    }).toArray(function(err, documents) {
    
    })

If your program does not finish executing, you may have forgotten to
close the db. That can be done by calling db.close() after you
have finished.
